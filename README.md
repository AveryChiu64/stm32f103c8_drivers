# STM32F103C8 Drivers
These are GPIO,I2C,USART, and SPI drivers written for an STM32F103C8 (blue pill). This is based off of the stm32f103xx reference manual.

The code was written with STM32CubeIDE \
https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html

The reference manual can be found here \

## Getting Started
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/AveryChiu64/stm32f103c8_drivers.git

```
## Credits
These drivers are loosely based off of a course called Mastering Microcontroller with Embedded Driver Development from Udemy, but the driver is a different
model from the one used in that course.
